# Gradient-Descent-Python
# using Boston House Pricing Datset

I tried to find the optimal value of parameters using gradient descent algorithm and the code is written in python.

Tried to predict Boston House Prices designing Gradient Descent Algorithm.
The algorithm mentioned can be changed easily to batch and mini-batch version as well.
